## **Ruby on Rails Consulting — practical help when your product needs to move faster.**
If you’re carrying tech debt, stuck on an old Rails version, or fighting slow pages and flaky deploys, you don’t need a pep talk—you need a plan.
This page outlines how we upgrade Rails apps to **Rails 8** (with **Ruby 3.3**), fix performance bottlenecks, and set up CI/CD so you can ship reliably.
Whether you’re a startup stabilizing a growing product or an established team preparing for a major release, our approach is hands-on, measured, and focused on outcomes.<br/><br/>
Below, we’ll cover five areas: **when to hire**, **upgrades & migrations**, **performance**, **DevOps/SRE**, and **how we work**.
## <br/>

<p className="font-bold text-[#0094de] text-center italic">1. When to Hire Rails Consultants: Symptoms & Outcomes</p>
<br/>

If any of these feel familiar, bringing in senior Rails help is usually ROI-positive within weeks:

- Releases are unpredictable; hotfixes dominate the roadmap.
- Rails 5.x/6.x/7.x with unmaintained gems makes upgrades risky.
- p95 interaction delays, timeouts, and N+1 queries hurt conversion.
- CI pipelines take 20–40 minutes; failures feel random.
- On-call is noisy; little visibility into errors and slow queries.

**What you should expect from us:**

- **Predictable releases** (stabilized CI, clear branching & reviews)
- **Faster app** (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 targets)
- **Modern stack** (Rails 8 + Ruby 3.3, audited dependencies)
- **Sane operations** (observability, runbooks, error budgets)

<p className="font-bold text-[#0094de] text-center italic">2. Rails Upgrades & Migrations: From Risky to Routine</p>
<br/>

**Typical starting points**

- Rails 5.2/6.0/6.1/7.x → **Rails 8**, plus **Ruby 3.3**
- Gem ecosystem audit (security, maintenance, forks)
- Frontend: ERB/Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus) or SPA boundaries

**How we de-risk upgrades**

1. **Compatibility audit** — deprecations, gems, frameworks, CI.
2. **Dual-boot** (if needed) — run old/new Rails in parallel.
3. **Incremental PRs** — small, testable steps with feature flags.
4. **Zero/low-downtime deploys** — DB migrations, background jobs.
5. **Rollbacks & monitoring** — alerts, dashboards, error tracking.

**Deliverables**

- Upgrade plan & timeline, risk register, gem decisions
- Passing test suite and green pipeline
- Post-upgrade hardening (security, performance quick wins)

<p className="font-bold text-[#0094de] text-center italic">3. Performance & Scalability: Faster Pages, Happier Users</p>
<br/>

**Where we look first**

- **Database:** slow queries, missing indexes, connection pool size
- **App layer:** N+1s, caching strategy, background vs inline work
- **Frontend:** image sizing, asset pipeline, hydration cost
- **CWV:** LCP (hero render), INP (long tasks), CLS (layout shifts)

**Common fixes**

- Query plans & indexes; partitioning for large tables
- Caching (fragment/low-cardinality), job queues (Sidekiq), rate limits
- CDN for static assets; image compression; proper `width/height`
- Bundle/JS diet; defer non-critical scripts; preconnect fonts

**Measuring impact**

- Baseline → changes → remeasure with dashboards & CrUX/PSI
- Target: **LCP ≤ 2.5s**, **INP ≤ 200ms**, **CLS ≤ 0.1**
- Report with before/after, rollback notes, and owner assignments

<p className="font-bold text-[#0094de] text-center italic">4. DevOps, SRE & Reliability: CI/CD that You Can Trust</p>
<br/>

**Tooling we prefer**

- GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes (when warranted)
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana, logs/metrics/traces, Sentry
- Blue/green & canary; feature flags; automated rollbacks

**What we implement**

- **10–20 min pipelines** with test sharding & caching
- **Immutable builds** and environment parity
- **Runbooks & SLIs/SLOs** with alerting that respects sleep

**Results**

- Higher deploy frequency, lower MTTR, calmer on-call

<p className="font-bold text-[#0094de] text-center italic">5. How We Work: A Clear Path from Audit to Outcomes</p>
<br/>

**Engagement flow**

1. **Discovery (free)** — goals, constraints, success metrics
2. **Technical audit (1–2 weeks)** — code, DB, infra, performance, security
3. **Plan & estimate** — milestones, risks, owner map
4. **Build & iterate** — weekly demos, pairing, PR reviews
5. **Handover** — docs, runbooks, training, backlog for the next quarter

**Models**

- **Fixed-scope delivery** (audits, upgrades, performance sprints)
- **Team extension** (embed senior Rails engineers)
- **Maintenance retainer** (security updates, SLAs)
